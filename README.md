# PortaBilling MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes PortaBillingâ€™s OpenAPI endpoints as MCP resources. This server enables Large Language Models to discover and interact with REST APIs defined by OpenAPI specifications via the MCP protocol.

---

# User Guide

This section covers how to use the MCP server as an end user with Claude Desktop, Cursor, or other MCP-compatible tools.

## Quick Start for Users

Using with Claude Desktop (Stdio Transport)

Clone this repository. Install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/portaone/mcp-portabilling
cd mcp-portabilling
npm install
npm run build
cd examples/auth-provider-example
npm install
npm run build
```

Next, you need to configure your Claude Desktop application to connect to the PortaBilling MCP server. Open your Claude Desktop configuration file and add the following to the `mcpServers` object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "portabilling": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "/home/username/mcp-openapi-server/examples/auth-provider-example/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "API_BASE_URL": "https://demo.portaone.com:8444/rest",
        "OPENAPI_SPEC_PATH": "https://demo.portaone.com:8444/doc/api/CustomerInterface.json",
        "PORTABILLING_LOGIN_ID": "your_login",
        "PORTABILLING_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "API_HEADERS": ""
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Make sure to replace `"your_login"` and `"your_password"` with your actual PortaBilling credentials (the example above refers to the Retail realm).

# PortaBilling Authentication Provider for MCP OpenAPI Server

## Overview

This section explains how to use the `PortaBillingAuthProvider` to connect the MCP OpenAPI Server to a PortaBilling API server. This custom authentication provider handles the specific authentication flow required by PortaBilling, including initial login with username and password, and subsequent token refreshes.

The `PortaBillingAuthProvider` is designed to be used with the Claude Desktop example, allowing you to interact with the PortaBilling API through the MCP server.

## Authentication Flow

The `PortaBillingAuthProvider` implements the following authentication flow:

1.  **Initial Login**: When the server starts, the `PortaBillingAuthProvider` makes a `POST` request to the `/Session/login` endpoint of the PortaBilling API with the provided username and password.

2.  **Token Storage**: Upon successful login, the provider stores the `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and token expiry time.

3.  **Authenticated Requests**: For each subsequent request to the PortaBilling API, the provider adds the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.

4.  **Token Expiration Check**: Before making a request, the provider checks if the access token is expired or about to expire.

5.  **Token Refresh**: If the access token is expired and a refresh token is available, the provider makes a `POST` request to the `/Session/refresh_access_token` endpoint with the refresh token to get a new access token.

6.  **Re-login**: If the refresh token is not available or the refresh fails, the provider will attempt to re-login using the original username and password.

7.  **Error Handling**: The provider includes specific error handling for `500` status codes from the PortaBilling API. If a `500` error is received, it will attempt to refresh the token or re-login to recover the session.

## Common Patterns

The `PortaBillingAuthProvider` included in this repository serves as a comprehensive example of implementing the `AuthProvider` interface for a real-world API with a complex authentication flow (initial login, token refresh, and error recovery). Please refer to its section and the source code in `examples/auth-provider-example/` for a detailed implementation pattern.

### OpenAPI Schema Processing

#### Reference Resolution

This MCP server implements robust OpenAPI reference (`$ref`) resolution to ensure accurate representation of API schemas:

- **Parameter References**: Fully resolves `$ref` pointers to parameter components in the OpenAPI spec
- **Schema References**: Handles nested schema references within parameters and request bodies
- **Recursive References**: Prevents infinite loops by detecting and handling circular references
- **Nested Properties**: Preserves complex nested object and array structures with all their attributes

### Input Schema Composition

The server intelligently merges parameters and request bodies into a unified input schema for each tool:

- **Parameters + Request Body Merging**: Combines path, query, and body parameters into a single schema
- **Collision Handling**: Resolves naming conflicts by prefixing body properties that conflict with parameter names
- **Type Preservation**: Maintains the original type information for all schema elements
- **Metadata Retention**: Preserves descriptions, formats, defaults, enums, and other schema attributes

### Complex Schema Support

The MCP server handles various OpenAPI schema complexities:

- **Primitive Type Bodies**: Wraps non-object request bodies in a "body" property
- **Object Bodies**: Flattens object properties into the tool's input schema
- **Array Bodies**: Properly handles array schemas with their nested item definitions
- **Required Properties**: Tracks and preserves which parameters and properties are required
